#100Devs Simple Express App Submission

### Goal: Make Your Own CRUD APP and Push To Heroku

### How to submit your code for review:
I have completed the challenge. Since my frontend and backend are in separate repos I am mentioning the links here
### Frontend: https://github.com/saira512dev/QUIZ
### Backend : https://github.com/saira512dev/API-Quiz

### Live link: https://js-quiz-100devs.netlify.app/admin.html

It lets the user play a javascript quiz. Admin can also add/edit/delete questions. Added questions will be avaialable in quiz.

I feel good about my code: 4
```
