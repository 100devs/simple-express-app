This is social media site where people can share tips for caring for plants. Along with sharing tips, people will be able to share photos of their plants and comment for help with their own garden.


Link to project: coming soon.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

In the early stages of design and structure. Currently building out the sever and data base for functional storage and access.

Optimizations: coming soon

Lessons Learned: At this point much of the learning has come from the relationship of server side code in relation to client side code and how to implement it properly. I have also experimented heavily with using HTML templates(EJS). More to come as I continue working on the project.
