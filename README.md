#100Devs Simple Express App Submission

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4

I feel I have a strong grasp on the basic CRUD concepts. I went farther with my project so I feel I may not have done things in the most optimal way. Also I have weird errors with my Put requests but it isn't major!
