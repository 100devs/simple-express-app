# My Awesome Project
A full stack app to log hours driven for student drivers, including night and highway hours. You are able to add each lesson individually, inputting the total number of hours driven for that lesson, and then how many were at night or on the highway. A log of all cumulative hours is displayed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport for Authentication

My 17 year old son is about to start taking driving lessons to get his license. When I looked for apps to log these lessons they were rated badly and overly complicated. I wanted just a simple log to keep track of his lessons so I decided to create one. I used HTML and CSS for the front end, with EJS as a templating language and TailwindCSS to style it. On the backend I used JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. I chose MongoDB for my database and used Passport for login/logout and authentication.

## Optimizations
I really want to keep this app very simple but in the future I'd like to add:
- A section for upcoming lessons
- A way to output lessons as proof for areas that require a log of your hours driven
- Linking to google calendar

## Lessons Learned:

I chose this app to practice styling using TailwindCSS rather than using plain CSS or using a Template.
