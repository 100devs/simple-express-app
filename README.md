# Tabletop Character Builder
This is my tabletop character builder. This is a collection of tools for Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) dungeon masters to use for the creation of monsters for their games. The goal here is to be able create a monster from anywhere and then export the resulting json sheet to be able to be imported into various virtual tabletops.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, Node.js

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

Where to start? User authentication is probably the bane of my existence. However, the amount of errors that occured during the development process gave me a huge appreciation for paying attention to small things and getting interested in TDD/BDD.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Twitter Battle:** https://github.com/alecortega/twitter-battle
